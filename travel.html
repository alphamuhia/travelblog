            <p style="background-color: aqua;">he National Museums of Kenya (NMK; Swahili: Makumbusho ya Kitaifa ya
                Kenya) is a state corporation that
                manages museums, sites and monuments in Kenya. It carries out heritage research, and has expertise in
                subjects ranging from palaeontology, archeology, ethnography and biodiversity research and conservation.
                Its headquarters and the National Museum (Nairobi National Museum) are located on Museum Hill, near
                Uhuru Highway between Central Business District and Westlands in Nairobi. The National Museum of Kenya
                was founded by the East Africa Natural History Society (E.A.N.H.S.) in 1910; the society's main goal has
                always been to conduct an ongoing critical scientific examination of the natural attributes of the East
                African habitat. The museum houses collections, and temporary and permanent exhibits. Today the National
                Museum of Kenya manages over 22 regional museums, many sites, and monuments across the country.[1]</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">History</h2>
            <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">The history of the institution dates back in 1910 when a museum was established in Nairobi by the then
                East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society [currently the East African Natural History Society
                (EANHS)]. The group consisted mainly of colonial settlers and naturalists who needed a place to keep and
                preserve their collections of various specimens. Its first site was at the present Nyayo House. The site
                soon became small and a larger building was put up in 1922 where the Nairobi Serena Hotel stands.

                It was not until 1929 that the colonial government set aside land at the Museum Hill and construction
                work started at the current site. It was officially opened in Sept. 22 1930 and named Coryndon Museum in
                honour of Sir Robert Coryndon, one time Governor of Kenya and a staunch supporter of Uganda Natural
                History Society. On the attainment of independence in 1963, it was re-named NMK. Since 1960s, NMK has
                expanded its services and assets to include Regional Museums , and has acquired under its jurisdiction
                Sites and Monuments which the Government has set aside as monuments of national heritage. Each of the
                Regional Museums has its own identity and develops its own programmes. The museum has also established
                Collaborations, Research and Development programmes, for instance, The Institute of Primate Research and
                RISSEA .

                The expansion of its mandate and the staff numbers coupled with the dynamic environment in which NMK
                operates has put enormous challenges for the institution. In order to keep abreast with changes in the
                environment in which it is operating, NMK had to redefine its operations to become more responsive to
                the changing circumstances. This meant moving towards developing museum as a place where people from all
                walks of life meet and have dialogue on various socio-economic issues. It called for NMK to develop
                programmes that promote cultural dynamism in order to build a sense of nationhood and belonging.</p>

            <p style="background-color: aqua;">Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in
                1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south
                of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to
                move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry
                season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations,
                changing land use and poaching of wildlife. Despite its proximity to the city and its relative small
                size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful
                rhinoceros sanctuaries.</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">History</h2>
            <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">British colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late
                19th century. At this time, the Athi
                plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded
                their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi
                grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the
                city carried guns at night to protect against lions. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive
                plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game
                reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among
                gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.

                The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in
                1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled.
                Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a
                paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National
                Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every
                other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed.
                Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government
                formed a committee to examine the matter.

                Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya.
                Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created.[8] Cowie was named as
                director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel
                arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation
                and wildlife protection image.

                On 5 March 2024, a Cessna 172 belonging to a flying school crashed into the park after figuring in a
                mid-air collision with a Dash 8 passenger aircraft operated by Safarilink Aviation, killing all two
                people aboard the Cessna</p>
