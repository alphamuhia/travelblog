                <h2>Meet Alpha Peter</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Alpha Peter, and I’m a web designer and student at Zindua Coding School. I have a
                    passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly websites that blend creativity and functionality.

                <p>Over the years, I’ve discovered that traveling around Kenya has inspired not just my love for local
                    cuisine but also my desire to connect with different communities and learn from their unique
                    perspectives.</p>
